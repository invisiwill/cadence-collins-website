# Research: Cadence Collins Campaign Website

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Feature**: Political candidate website with CMS functionality  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Findings

### Mailing List Data Storage (FR-011 Resolution)
**Decision**: Supabase PostgreSQL with email validation  
**Rationale**: User specified Supabase for data storage. PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance for subscriber data, built-in email validation, and easy CSV export capabilities for campaign use.  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Mailchimp API integration (rejected - additional complexity, cost)
- Local JSON storage (rejected - no persistence across deployments)
- Firebase (rejected - user specified Supabase)

### Social Media Platforms (FR-012 Resolution)  
**Decision**: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok integration  
**Rationale**: User explicitly specified these three platforms as target social media channels for the campaign.  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Twitter/X (not specified by user)
- LinkedIn (not typical for school board campaigns)
- YouTube (not specified by user)

### Events Data Source (FR-013 Resolution)
**Decision**: Supabase database with admin CMS interface  
**Rationale**: User requested backend functionality for event management. Dynamic events stored in database allow real-time updates without code deployments.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Static markdown files (rejected - no admin interface)  
- External calendar API (rejected - additional complexity)
- Hardcoded events (rejected - no admin functionality requested)

### Policy Section Scope (FR-014 Resolution)
**Decision**: Bullet points with sample data, CMS-editable  
**Rationale**: User specified "bullet points with sample data" and requested CMS functionality for policy content management.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Detailed policy papers (rejected - not specified, would increase complexity)
- External policy link (rejected - user wants on-page content)
- Static content only (rejected - user wants CMS capability)

## Technology Stack Validation

### Next.js Framework Selection
**Decision**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript  
**Rationale**: User specified Next.js. Version 14+ provides App Router, optimized performance, and native TypeScript support. Ideal for single-page applications with API routes.  
**Best Practices**:
- Use App Router for file-based routing
- Implement Server Components for better performance  
- API routes for backend functionality
- Static generation where possible for SEO

### Supabase Integration Patterns
**Decision**: Direct Supabase client usage with Row Level Security  
**Rationale**: Supabase provides TypeScript client, real-time subscriptions, and built-in auth if needed later.  
**Best Practices**:
- Use Supabase client in API routes for server-side operations
- Implement RLS policies for data security
- Use database functions for complex queries
- Connection pooling for production deployment

### Tailwind CSS + Blue Color Scheme
**Decision**: Custom Tailwind theme extending default colors  
**Rationale**: User specified Tailwind and blue color scheme from provided assets. Custom theme ensures consistent branding.  
**Best Practices**:
- Extract colors from `../assets/card.png` and `../assets/card2.png`
- Define custom color palette in tailwind.config.js
- Use CSS custom properties for dynamic theme support
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

### Authentication Strategy  
**Decision**: Basic admin authentication for CMS functionality  
**Rationale**: Admin needs to manage mailing list and events. Simple auth sufficient for single-user campaign management.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- No authentication (rejected - admin functionality needed)
- OAuth (rejected - overcomplicated for single user)
- Magic link auth (considered viable alternative)

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Model Strategy
**Decision**: Direct database entity mapping to TypeScript interfaces  
**Rationale**: Simple campaign site doesn't need complex DTOs. Direct mapping reduces boilerplate and improves maintainability.

### Testing Approach
**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright E2E  
**Rationale**: Standard Next.js testing stack. RTL for component testing, Playwright for user flows including form submissions and admin features.

### Deployment Strategy  
**Decision**: Vercel deployment with Supabase cloud database  
**Rationale**: User mentioned Vercel deployment. Native Next.js integration, preview deployments for staging, automatic HTTPS.

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**:
- Next.js + Tailwind implementation (well-established stack)
- Supabase integration (excellent TypeScript support)
- Single-page design (minimal routing complexity)

**Medium Risk**:  
- Color extraction from provided assets (manual design work required)
- CSV export functionality (custom implementation needed)
- Admin authentication (security considerations)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Extract colors early in Phase 1 for validation
- Use well-tested CSV libraries (papaparse)
- Implement secure admin routes with proper validation
